      As a UI/UX Designer at EDGE, I'm driven by creativity, curiosity, and the goal of crafting meaningful digital experiences. 
      I strive to blend aesthetics with functionality, ensuring every design tells a story and serves a purpose. 
      My vision is to create user-centered designs that inspire connection, simplify complexity, and elevate how people interact with technology.
